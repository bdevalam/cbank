Important! To comply with an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, if you send unsolicited email marketing campaigns promoting products sold through ClickBank, you must not send unsolicited marketing emails to the domains owned and/or operated by XMission LC listed on the linked suppression list. Sending unsolicited marketing emails to the domains on the linked suppression list may be considered a violation of the CAN-SPAM Act and, therefore, a breach of your obligations under Section 6 of the Client Contract, and could expose you or ClickBank to court action, including potential monetary penalties, and immediate termination of your ClickBank account. This requirement does not prohibit you from responding to potential customer inquiries, sending order confirmations or tracking information or responding to customer service requests.Additionally, the linked suppression list is "Confidential Information" under Section 9 of the ClickBank Client Contract. You shall not disclose or use the linked suppression list except as necessary to comply with the court order and ensure that the domains on the list are scrubbed from your email campaigns. Any use or disclosure of the attached suppression list beyond this limited scope is a breach of your Client Contract. Additionally, XMission is a third-party beneficiary of the designation of the suppression list as Confidential Information under the Client Contract, and you acknowledge and agree that XMission may enforce your failure to maintain its confidentiality, including the right to seek injunctive relief under Section 19.h. of the Client Contract.
